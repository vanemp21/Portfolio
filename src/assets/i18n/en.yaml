  "Sobre mi":"About me",
  "Mi comienzo":"My beginning",
  "Mi comienzo texto":"My name is Vanessa, I am 33 years old and I was born in a small town in Switzerland (Domat Ems), since my parents emigrated there for work, the typical thing that was done in the past. When I was 8 years old we returned to Spain since my parents missed their land, their climate and of course, the food here! We moved to Alicante and we settled there practically all our lives until now, when I moved to Córoba, exactly to Lucena.",
  "Mi camino actual":"My current path",
  "Mi camino actual texto":"After many years and having completed all my studies as a Web Application Design Technician (and others) I decided to try my luck in Lucena, where I found love and I currently live with him, trying to form a future together and dedicate myself to developing, which although It is what you will read the most today, I say it too and that is that I love web development.",
  "Mi futuro":"My future",
  "Mi futuro texto": "I am currently looking for a job and I can assure that the opportunity that the future company offers me will earn the same with me as I do with them. I am a simple person, but with an impressive hunger for success, which makes me learn and improve day by day. Work, if you enjoy it, is not work, so that is my case and I love to always look for information on how the most used or new technologies work, or if I am in a company, I like to look for information on how to improve in my job. It sounds a bit silly, but I can attest that I enjoy developing and that's what I want to dedicate myself to. Maybe I don't know everything in the world of development due to my inexperience, but believe me, I am a decisive person and what I don't know, I end up achieving because I have no difficulty finding solutions to problems.",
  "Para finalizar":"To finish",
  "Para finalizar texto":"Lastly, I simply want to highlight that I am an empathetic and honest person, with interpersonal skills, creativity and a good adaptation to teamwork. If you want to discover more about me, I invite you to contact me, even if it's just to send me a greeting. Thank you for your time, I value every second you have taken to read me.",
