  "Mi futuro texto": "I am currently looking for a job and I can assure that the opportunity that the future company offers me will earn the same with me as I do with them. I am a simple person, but with an impressive hunger for success, which makes me learn and improve day by day. Work, if you enjoy it, is not work, so that is my case and I love to always look for information on how the most used or new technologies work, or if I am in a company, I like to look for information on how to improve in my job. It sounds a bit silly, but I can attest that I enjoy developing and that's what I want to dedicate myself to. Maybe I don't know everything in the world of development due to my inexperience, but believe me, I am a decisive person and what I don't know, I end up achieving because I have no difficulty finding solutions to problems.",

If you want to discover more about me, I invite you to contact me, even if it's just to send me a greeting. Thank you for your time, I value every second you have taken to read me.",
